# How to Use
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-- Scraping IMDb:

    	* When the script is first run, the application will automatically scrape IMDb for movie data based on the genres provided.
    	* The scraping will be done in the background, and a progress bar will appear in the GUI.
    	* Once scraping is completed, the data is saved into a CSV file called movies_1.csv for future use. You do not need to re-scrape unless you want fresh data.


	-- After Scraping Completes:

    	* Once the scraping is finished, the genre and rating input fields will be displayed to allow the user to filter the suggestions.
    	* Users can choose the genre, set a minimum rating, and then click "Suggest Movie/TV Show" to get a random movie suggestion and the top 15 movies based on their criteria.


	-- Running the App:

    	* Once the script is running, a GUI window will pop up with the following inputs:
        * Choose Genre: You can select a genre from the dropdown list (Action, Comedy, Drama, Thriller, or "All").
        * Minimum Rating: You can enter a minimum rating (numeric value) for the movie suggestions.
        * Click "Suggest Movie/TV Show": The application will suggest a random movie and display the top 15 movies that match the selected genre and rating.
		* If no movies match the selected filters, a message will inform you that no movies were found.

# Code Explanation
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-- Scraping IMDb

		The script uses Selenium to scrape data from IMDb. The function scrape_imdb():

    			* Navigates to IMDb's search page for specific genres.
    			* Scrapes the movie title, release year, and rating for each movie.
    			* Continues to scrape additional pages by clicking the "50 more" button to load more movies.
    			* Appends each movie’s data (title, genre, release year, rating) to a list and then saves the data in a CSV file called movies_1.csv
				

	-- Loading and Cleaning Data

		* The load_movie_data() function loads the movie data from the movies_1.csv file into a pandas DataFrame:
		* NaN values in the columns Title and Rating are removed, as these columns are essential for filtering and displaying the movie 			suggestions.


	-- Filtering Movies

		The filter_movies() function filters the movies based on two criteria:

    		* Genre: Only movies that match the selected genre will be included.
    		* Minimum Rating: Only movies with a rating greater than or equal to the specified rating will be included.


	-- Suggesting Random and Top Movies

		The suggest_random_and_top_movies() function:

    			* Filters the movie data according to the user’s specified genre and rating.
    			* Returns one random movie suggestion from the filtered list.
    			* Returns the top 15 movies (sorted by top IMDB ratings).


	-- GUI Setup

		The Tkinter GUI allows users to interact with the application.

			* A window showing progress of scraping opens. When the scrapig is 100% done the GUI then takes input from user.
			* A dropdown menu for selecting the genre.
    		* An input field for entering a minimum rating.
    		* Displays a button that, when clicked, shows the random movie suggestion and the list of top 15 movies.

# Troubleshooting
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    	* Missing WebDriver: If you encounter errors related to missing the Chrome WebDriver, ensure you have Google Chrome installed and that the 		webdriver-manager library is correctly set up to manage the WebDriver.

    	* Missing Data: If the application fails to scrape data from IMDb or doesn't find any movies, it might be because IMDb has changed its structure 	or the script can't load the page properly. You might need to inspect the page and adjust the scraping code accordingly.
